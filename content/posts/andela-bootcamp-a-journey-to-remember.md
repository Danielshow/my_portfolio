Today is my sixth day at Andela bootcamp and I am so confident and happy with how I have adapted in the last few days.
Today, I was faced with the toughest challenge ever that took me four hours to figure out. I integrated Postgresql database in my API, it was running locally, I was very happy and thought the biggest task is gone. As I wanted to create a pull request, I saw that the build has failed on Travis.

The skills of asking questions that I have acquired came into play and I ask a lot of questions, test different methods to no avail. The new methods I tried make me know more about Travis and Postgresql. I searched on Google, medium, StackOverflow and various platforms but no answer. I decided to cool down and checked my errors, At last, I found out the errors, commit and push to GitHub. I was very happy and fulfilled when it passed.
