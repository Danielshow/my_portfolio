I had a friend who struggled with Redux for a Long time and his main story was “He can’t get a hang of it, or the flow is mysterious”. Later, I got to know some people struggle with Redux because of its flow. In this tutorial, we will go through an easy way to get Redux setup for your React project and build a simple application with it.
There are lots of excitement going on about context API and React hooks, but I still feel Redux is perfect for large applications.

> Note: I won’t be explaining some react concept like state and lifecycle, I will suggest you follow a react course if you don’t know React. Redux provides a simpler way to manage your state in a central store.  N.B — React can be used without Redux using local states but Redux provides you with a centralised store, managing all you states in a simpler way.
