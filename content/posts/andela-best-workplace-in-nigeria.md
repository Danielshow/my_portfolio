This year, Andela bagged the award of Jobberman Best 100 Companies to Work for in Nigeria. I have longed to work for Andela since 2014 when it was opened, I was even planning to quit school if I was called but then I wrote the text and failed. No hard feelings though, Andela pushed me to learn a lot and now I am currently at Andela’s bootcamp.

Reflecting on being the best company to work for in Nigeria, having worked with different companies and today is my second day at Andela bootcamp, with the things I have seen and the help Andelans are rendering, I can vividly say Andela is the best company to work for in Nigeria.

The reason Andela rose exponentially in the course of 5 years to become the best company to work for cannot be far-fetched, Andela values have made them stand out among other companies. Andela is one of those few places where you work and have peace of mind. The key points for Andela values are EPIC (Excellence, Passion, Integrity and Collaboration).
